We develop an earable sensing platform, it can extract your heart sound using in-ear microphones of an commercial available ANC earphone. Meanwhile, it can also grasp motion induced artifacts using a 9-DOF IMU sensor units. We mainly develop it for the current hot issues on earable computing and sensing. It can serve as a platform for:
1. Earable computing and sensing
2. Spatial audio
3. Heart sound analysis
4. Active noise cancellation
5. Sound localization and sensing

The platform consists of two parts:
1. A hardware that streams all collected samples
2. An client side app (Android or PC) that accept all the streams and performs real-time sensing operation.
